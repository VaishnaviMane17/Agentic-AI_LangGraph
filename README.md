# Agentic-AI_LangGraph
## Exploring Agentic AI using LangGraph for Email Sorting

This project is a fun and practical take on using AI to sort emails automatically. Built with LangGraph, LangChain, and OpenAI's language models, it mimics how a human might read and organize emails—deciding whether something is work-related, personal, promotional, or just plain spam. The notebook walks through how to set up the agent, how it thinks through decisions using a graph-based workflow, and how it learns to handle different types of messages. It’s a great introduction to building intelligent, agent-driven systems for real-world tasks like email triage.
